This is our fourth lesson.
Let's do something with our knowledge so far.
One of the first task is to print the numbers from 1 to 10.
With all that we know, the only way is to say "print" and corresponding number.
Example:
    print(1)
    print(2)
    print(3)
Of course, this is not the only way to print numbers, even this is not a way at all but for now...

Here is the moment to introduce the 'variable"
The variable is the place where we store data. As the name suggest, the stored data can be modified.
Let see one example:

a = 5
print(a)
a = 6
print(a)

In this example first we assign a value to the variable and then modify it.
Python allow this. In many other language this is not possible.
