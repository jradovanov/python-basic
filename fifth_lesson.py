This is our fifth lesson
In last lesson we found the variables.
They have "name", "type" and "value"
name - have to choose a properly one
type - "int", "float", "str"
value - a number, a text, a picture, data, list...
In Python the value defined the type
Let's solve a problem for example:
How much is 5 x 6?
Let's make three variables:
a = 5
b = 6
c = a * b
print(c)
In this example we will receive 30 as result. But not the result is interested in this case.
The important is that we operate with variables and that variables could be manipulated and reused.

This is all in this lesson
In lesson 6 we will learn how sites greeting you by name.

See you!
