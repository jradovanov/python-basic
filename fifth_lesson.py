This is our fifth lesson
In last lesson we found the variables.
They have "name", "type" and "value"
name - have to choose a properly one
type - "int", "float", "str"
value - a number, a text, a picture, data, list...
In Python the value defined the type
Let's solve a problem for example:
How much is 5 x 6?
Let's make three variables:
a = 5
b = 6
c = a x b
print(c)
