After you have PyCharm ready with a directory and file/files, you can choose one of them on the left.
Double-click on it and it will open in the middle. This is where you will write your code.
When you finish, you can close the file by clicking on the X in the right corner next to the file name.
The file will be saved on the left and can be opened again whenever you want.

The first program you will write in any computer language is usually the "Hello, World!" program.
o do that in Python, you can use the built-in function print(). First, type print() and put the text
that you want to be displayed inside the parentheses. If the text is a string, you need to put it
inside quotation marks. So, the code will look like this: print("Hello, World!").

To see the result of your code, you need to run it. Right-click anywhere in the file window and select
"Run 'name of your file'". If your file is named "test", the command will be "Run 'test'".
If everything is correct, you should see a new window appear below the main one with the text
"Hello, World!" displayed. If there is an error in your code, such as misspelling the print function
or forgetting the parentheses, an error message will appear in red text explaining the mistake.

If everything works correctly, congratulations! You have written your first Python program using the print() function.
The print() function is used to display the result of your code.

Another way to display text is to use variables. Variables are used to store data that you want to use later
in your code. Every variable has a name that tells you what it is used for. To create a variable,
simply give it a name. Let's name our first variable "greeting". The code will look like this:
greeting = "Hello, World!".
The name of the variable should not be in quotes, even if it is a string.

Once you have created a variable, you can display its contents using the print() function.
This time, instead of putting the text inside the parentheses, you will put the name of the variable.
So the final code will look like this:

bash
Copy code
greeting = "Hello, World!"
print(greeting)
Now you can run the code in the same way as before, either by right-clicking and selecting "Run",
or by using the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + F10. Note that when you use the print() function with a variable,
you do not need to use quotation marks around the variable name.

In this lesson, you have learned:

How to use the print() function to display text
How to create variables with descriptive names
How to assign values to variables using the = sign
How to display the contents of a variable using the print() function
The difference between putting text in quotes and using variables in the print() function.
