After you have PyCharm ready with Directory and file/ files you can choose one of them in the left.
Click twice over it and it will be open in the middle.
Now, this is the work plot for your code.
When you finish your job, to close the file have to click over the X in the right corner after the name
The file will be stored in the left and can be opened whenever you want.

First program:
As many computer language, the first task is to say: "Hallo world!"
To do that you have many ways.
The sample one is to use build in function - print()
First we write - print() and in the brackets have to put this that we want to be displayed.
If this is a text, we need to put in quotas. So, the code will be looks like that:
print("Hallo world!")
After that we need to perform some action if we want to see the result of our code.
To do that, click with the right button of your mouse somewhere in the window and from the context menu
choose: Run "name of your file" If your file is name it: "test", the command will be: Run "test"
When everything is correct you will be able to see a new window down of the main one where
the text "Hallo world!" is appeared. If something is wrong, let say the command is prin, not print, or
you forget the brackets... the red text with explanation of the mistake will appear.

So, if all is correct, you have your first code of python.
The function "print()" is the main function which we use everywhere when the result have to be shown.

The other way to do that is to use variable.
The variables also are main things that we have to use all the time.
Usually, every variable, when we make it, have name which tell us what it used for.
To make a variable we have just to write its name
Let's name it our first variable: "greeting"
In this case the code will looks like:
greeting = "Hallo world!"
The name of the variable is not in quotes never mind is also a text.
The sign "=" tells to the python - assign this text to the variable.
Now, when we are ready and have variable named: greeting, which contains the text "Hallo world!",
we have to displayed.
To do that, we have to use our function - print, but this time in the brackets will put our variable.

The final code will look like:

greeting = "Hallo world!"
print(greeting)
Now we have to start it in the familiar way or to use Ctrl + Shift + F10
Note that the name of variable is without a quotes in the bracket.
When we print() something, if we use quotes, the program will display what is in the quotes.
In this case, if we put greetings like this: print("greeting") it will display - greeting

So, in this lesson we understand that:
1. print() - is a build in function used to display the result of our code
2. In the quotes we can put this that we want to be displayed
3. To make a variables. To give them a name that will speak about its self
4. To assign to our variable what we need using sign "="
5 When we want to display what a variable keep, we have to call it.
For now, we call the variable used print() function
