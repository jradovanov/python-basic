Hello all!
Last lesson we used variables to add, multiply, divide and so on - numbers, as integers.
Same we can do of course with fractional numbers as float
Example:
a = float(input()) - let be 5.45
b = float(input()) - let be 4.38
c = a * b
print(c) - 23.871 will be the answer

Ok, but both examples from lesson 5 and lesson 6 are with numbers. How we can use the strings?
Let see how the system greeting you when you write your name.

Example:
    The user John wants to come inside our system
    We want to say "Hello" to John.
let's make a variable - name
    name = input() - because we expecting a string
    print(f"Hello, {name}!") - This will print to the console "Hello, John!" or the name you writed.
Here we see a couple new things.
