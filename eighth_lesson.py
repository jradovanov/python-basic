Hi all.
This is our eight lesson.
Today we will learn "if - else" construction.
This construction checks if a logical conditions is valid for a given expression.
Examples for such conditions are:
Equals - in Python equals is expressed with "=="
If we write "=" it means that it assign the value.
So, if we want to check "a" is equals or not to "b" have to write "=="
How to check:
First have to use "if" statement followed by condition a == b and ":" for the end.
The whole expression will be: if a == b:
<<<<<<< HEAD
After that, with one "tab"
