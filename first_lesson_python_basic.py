This is the beginning of our journey in python basic.
The first thing I wanted to know when I studied was how we can make such text as this one.
To make a commentary in your code you can use brackets as I do. This method give you
a possibility to make a text as long as you need.
The other way is to use - # before every row.

Example:
    # Some text

There is another way.
First you have to write what text you want, then select it all.
 To do that you can click somewhere in the window and push Ctrl + A.
 The push Ctrl + /. You will see all rows started with - #.
 Same way to uncomment.

What is a python?
Python is one of most popular and preferred program language. It is a intuitive, close to our speech
as possible. This is enough for beginning.

The first thing you need to do is to get the environment in which you will write your codes.
For this purpose, you have first to download and install the Python language.
You have to do it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ - first choose your OS.
When the language is installed, you need to download and install the environment where actually you will
be working. The most popular environment for Python is PyCharm.
Pycharm have to be downloaded from here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/
Choose first your OS and then choose: Community. This version is free and is enough for now.

When all is done, have to start PyCharm every time you want to work.
First step: choose Projects and then New Project from the menu in the left.
Second: Set the project directory and name it.
        leave the Base interpreter field filled with the default value.
Third: After the project is created, click over it with the right button, choose -> New -> Directory
       Name it! After that click, over Directory with right button, choose -> New -> Python File - Name it

That is all for now. If you want a new directory or a new file, follow the steps described above.

This is end of first lesson.
